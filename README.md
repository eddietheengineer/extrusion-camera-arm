# extrusion-camera-arm
I needed something to mount a camera to a monitor arm, so I figured I'd use some spare 2020 and 3d printed parts to be able to articulate off of my monitor arms (~30.3mm x 20.4mm rectangular steel tubing). 

Requires:

- 2020 Extrusion
- Monitor Arm (can adjust in Fusion model for your arm dimensions)
- M3 SHCS
- M3 Heatset Inserts
- M3 T-nut
